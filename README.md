# Omnipay: PayPal Standard

**PayPal driver for the Omnipay PHP payment processing library**

[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP. This package implements common classes required by Omnipay.

## Basic Usage

The following gateway are provided by this package:
- PayPal_Standard

PayPal_Standard allows to process payments only with the email of a PayPal account. This is not secure, so we strongly discourage their use.
